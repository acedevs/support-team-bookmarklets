# trello-checklist-to-card
Checks an open Trello card to see whether there are checklists on the card. If so, and if they have items in them, the bookmarklet will make a new card for each of the checklist items, and replace the old checklist item with a link to the card.

We have included three versions of the code: the full JS with comments, the full JS without comments, and the URL-encoded version of the code (for actually adding as a bookmarklet in your browser).
